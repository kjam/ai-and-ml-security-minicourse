    "### LLM as a Judge\n",
    "\n",
    "LLM as a Judge is a paradigm for generating synthetic data, improving models during fine-tuning and to monitoring output of the main model (our use case). \n",
    "\n",
    "The \"judge LLM\" is given a task to rate the conversation as a whole or a single response based on some criteria. These criteria can be human-labeled datasets collected over time, a set of rules or a series of in-learning examples. Ideally the judgement is then easily parseable  and uses a rating system that can be easily interpreted (i.e. scale of 1-10, yes/no, pass/fail). Note if using a scale, you'll need to also determine a threshhold when using this paradigm for guardrails or other monitoring.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can see an example from [HuggingFace of a LLM as a judge](https://huggingface.co/learn/cookbook/llm_judge).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Important note**: you can also train a smaller NLP model if you already have a set of human-reviewed responses, which might be most efficient for running this in a production or internal system."
